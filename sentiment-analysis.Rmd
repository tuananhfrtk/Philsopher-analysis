# About the Authors:

* **Edgar Allan Poe** (January 19, 1809 – October 7, 1849) was an American writer, editor, and literary critic. Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre. He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States and American literature as a whole, and he was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story. Poe is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction. He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career.

* **Howard Phillips Lovecraft** ( August 20, 1890 – March 15, 1937) was an American author who achieved posthumous fame through his influential works of horror fiction. He was virtually unknown and published only in pulp magazines before he died in poverty, but he is now regarded as one of the most significant 20th-century authors in his genre. Lovecraft was born in Providence, Rhode Island, where he spent most of his life. Among his most celebrated tales are "The Call of Cthulhu" and "The Shadow over Innsmouth", both canonical to the Cthulhu Mythos. Lovecraft was never able to support himself from earnings as author and editor. He saw commercial success increasingly elude him in this latter period, partly because he lacked the confidence and drive to promote himself. He subsisted in progressively strained circumstances in his last years; an inheritance was completely spent by the time that he died at age 46.

* **Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley**  ( 30 August 1797 – 1 February 1851) was an English novelist, short story writer, dramatist, essayist, biographer, and travel writer, best known for her Gothic novel Frankenstein: or, The Modern Prometheus (1818). She also edited and promoted the works of her husband, the Romantic poet and philosopher Percy Bysshe Shelley. Her father was the political philosopher William Godwin, and her mother was the philosopher and feminist Mary Wollstonecraft.


# Loading Packages and reading data

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(data.table)
library(sentimentr)
library(ggplot2)
library(stringr)
library('wordcloud')
library('tm')
library('SnowballC')
library('RSentiment')
library('DT')

train <- fread("../input/train.csv")
```

First we are going to separate the three authors in three different datasets

```{r}
eap <- train[author=="EAP"] # Edgar Allan Poe
hpl <- train[author=="HPL"] # HP Lovecraft
mws <- train[author=="MWS"] # Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley
```

Now that we have the datasets of each author we are going to start and analyse the Sentiment of each author

# Rsentiment Package: {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}


## Edgar Allan Poe

Here we are going to use the tm package to prepare the data and after that the Rsentiment package to calculate the sentiment. It classifies sentences into 6 categories: Positive, Negative, Very Positive, Very Negative Sarcasm and Neutral.

```{r results='hide',echo=TRUE}
corpus = Corpus(VectorSource(list(eap$text)))
corpus = tm_map(corpus, removePunctuation)
corpus = tm_map(corpus, content_transformer(tolower))
corpus = tm_map(corpus, removeNumbers) 
corpus = tm_map(corpus, stripWhitespace)
corpus = tm_map(corpus, removeWords, stopwords('english'))

dtm_eap = DocumentTermMatrix(VCorpus(VectorSource(corpus[[1]]$content)))
freq_eap <- colSums(as.matrix(dtm_eap))

sentiments_eap = calculate_sentiment(names(freq_eap))
sentiments_eap = cbind(sentiments_eap, as.data.frame(freq_eap))
```

Now is time to calculate the sentiment:

```{r}
sent_pos_eap = sentiments_eap[sentiments_eap$sentiment == 'Positive',]
sent_neg_eap = sentiments_eap[sentiments_eap$sentiment == 'Negative',]

cat("We have less negative Sentiments: ",sum(sent_neg_eap$freq_eap)," than positive: ",sum(sent_pos_eap$freq_eap))
```

### Wordcloud Positive Sentiments and Negative
 
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
wordcloud(sent_pos_eap$text,sent_pos_eap$freq, min.freq=30,colors=brewer.pal(6,"Dark2"),random.order = F)
text(x=0.5, y=1.05, "Positive")
wordcloud(sent_neg_eap$text,sent_neg_eap$freq, min.freq=20,colors=brewer.pal(6,"Dark2"),random.order = F)
text(x=0.5, y=1.05, "Negative")
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```


## HP Lovecraft


```{r results='hide',echo=TRUE}
corpus = Corpus(VectorSource(list(hpl$text)))
corpus = tm_map(corpus, removePunctuation)
corpus = tm_map(corpus, content_transformer(tolower))
corpus = tm_map(corpus, removeNumbers) 
corpus = tm_map(corpus, stripWhitespace)
corpus = tm_map(corpus, removeWords, stopwords('english'))

dtm_hpl = DocumentTermMatrix(VCorpus(VectorSource(corpus[[1]]$content)))
freq_hpl <- colSums(as.matrix(dtm_hpl))

sentiments_hpl = calculate_sentiment(names(freq_hpl))
sentiments_hpl = cbind(sentiments_hpl, as.data.frame(freq_hpl))
```

Sentiment

```{r}
sent_pos_hpl = sentiments_hpl[sentiments_hpl$sentiment == 'Positive',]
sent_neg_hpl = sentiments_hpl[sentiments_hpl$sentiment == 'Negative',]

cat("We have more negative Sentiments: ",sum(sent_neg_hpl$freq_hpl)," than positive: ",sum(sent_pos_hpl$freq_hpl))
```


### Wordcloud Positive Sentiments and Negative

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
wordcloud(sent_pos_hpl$text,sent_pos_hpl$freq, min.freq=30,colors=brewer.pal(6,"Dark2"),random.order = F)
text(x=0.5, y=1.05, "Positive")
wordcloud(sent_neg_hpl$text,sent_neg_hpl$freq, min.freq=20,colors=brewer.pal(6,"Dark2"),random.order = F)
text(x=0.5, y=1.05, "Negative")
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```

## Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley

```{r results='hide',echo=TRUE}
corpus = Corpus(VectorSource(list(mws$text)))
corpus = tm_map(corpus, removePunctuation)
corpus = tm_map(corpus, content_transformer(tolower))
corpus = tm_map(corpus, removeNumbers) 
corpus = tm_map(corpus, stripWhitespace)
corpus = tm_map(corpus, removeWords, stopwords('english'))

dtm_mws = DocumentTermMatrix(VCorpus(VectorSource(corpus[[1]]$content)))
freq_mws <- colSums(as.matrix(dtm_mws))

sentiments_mws = calculate_sentiment(names(freq_mws))
sentiments_mws = cbind(sentiments_mws, as.data.frame(freq_mws))
```

Now is time to calculate the sentiment:

```{r}
sent_pos_mws = sentiments_mws[sentiments_mws$sentiment == 'Positive',]
sent_neg_mws = sentiments_mws[sentiments_mws$sentiment == 'Negative',]

cat("We have less negative Sentiments: ",sum(sent_neg_mws$freq_mws)," than positive: ",sum(sent_pos_mws$freq_mws))
```

### Wordcloud Positive Sentiments and Negative

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
wordcloud(sent_pos_mws$text,sent_pos_mws$freq, min.freq=30,colors=brewer.pal(6,"Dark2"))
text(x=0.5, y=1.05, "Positive")
wordcloud(sent_neg_mws$text,sent_neg_mws$freq, min.freq=20,colors=brewer.pal(6,"Dark2"))
text(x=0.5, y=1.05, "Negative")
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```

# First Part: Conclusions

* **Edgar Allan Poe** is more positive than negative in his words, he uses words like *little*, *never* or *doubt* as negative words, meanwhile the positive words he uses are *well*, *great* and *found*
* **Hp Lovecraft** is more negative than positive, we can see negative words as *never*, *little*, *death* or *horror*, the main positive words he uses are *like*, *great*, *found* and *certain*.
* **Mary Wollstonecraft** Shelley is more positive than negative, she uses as negative words *never*, *death*, *tears*, *little* among others and as a positive words *love*, *found*,  *hope*, *like*.

Now is time to merge the three authors

```{r}
sentiments_Allan_Poe = cbind("Author"="Edgar_Allan_poe",sentiments_eap)

colnames(sentiments_HP_Lovecraft)[4] <- "freq"
sentiments_Mary = cbind("Author"="Mary_Wollstonecraft_Shelley",sentiments_mws)
colnames(sentiments_Mary)[4] <- "freq"

sentiments <- rbind(sentiments_Allan_Poe[,-2],sentiments_HP_Lovecraft[,-2],sentiments_Mary[,-2])
sentiments <- as.data.table(sentiments)
sentiments1 <- sentiments[,.N,by=.(sentiment,Author)]
sentiments1[,"Total":=sum(N),by=Author]
sentiments1 <- sentiments1[,.("Percentage"=100*N/Total),by=.(Author,sentiment)]


ggplot(sentiments1,aes(x = sentiment,y = Percentage ,fill=sentiment ))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  ggtitle("Authors Sentiments")+xlab("Sentiment")+ylab("% Sentiment")+ 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, size=8,hjust = 1))+
  facet_wrap(~Author)

```

```{r}

fam <- cbind(author,t(fam1))
colnames(fam) <- c("Character","Script_Lines","Neutral","Negative","Positive")
fam

```


# Sentimentr Package

Now we are going to use a different sentiment Analysis Package: sentimentr

```{r}

* **Edgar Allan Poe** is the one that have most text present in the data, also his score is significantly mode disperse than the other authors.
* **Hp Lovecraft** is the author with less text in the data, he doesnt have extreme sentimental texts and we can see that he tend to be slightly more negative than positive.
* **Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley** also doesnt usually use extreme sentimental texts, we can see that when she have extreme texts, is usually a positive one.

Hope you like it!
